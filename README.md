# Data Sprint Project

## Scenario
Olist, a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform, had built its growth on aggressive digital marketing and promotional campaigns. While these efforts successfully brought in a large volume of first-time buyers, repeat purchases and long-term customer loyalty remained below expectations. They approached us to answer a critical question: How can we use behavioral data to understand and improve customer experience?
## Approaches
1- Analyze loyalty and churn across different regions in Brazil.

2- identify loyal vs. churning customers and analyze what drives retention.

3- Determine when customer growth or loss happens across months and seasons.

4- Evaluate which categories increase loyalty or contribute to churn.

5- Compare review behavior between one-time and repeat customers.

6- Measure how delivery speed affects customer retention.

## Definiations
**What is e-commerce?**
e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.[1]

**ًWhat is the B2B model Olist implements?**
Olist acts as a platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with major Brazilian marketplaces such as Extra, Shoptime, Walmart, and Submarino. Olist helps these merchants manage sales across multiple platforms, streamline stock management, and handle order fulfillment, which is a significant pain point for SMBs with limited resources.[2]
