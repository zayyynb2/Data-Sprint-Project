# Data Sprint Project

## Scenario 
#### Olist, a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform, had built its growth on aggressive digital marketing and promotional campaigns. While these efforts successfully brought in a large volume of first-time buyers, repeat purchases and long-term customer loyalty remained below expectations. They approached us to answer a critical question: How can we use behavioral data to understand and improve customer experience?
